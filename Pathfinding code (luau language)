-- This is basically a loop where the the sprite, otherwise models in luau, moves to every waypoints in the folder 'Waypoints_Beginners--
-- humanoid in luau means a sprite that has a player-like behaviour--
-- moveTo is a function that moves the sprite to a specific place, which is the waypoints--
-- GetChildren, in this case, is a function that collects all the parts (Waypoints) inside the folder Waypoints_Beginners--
