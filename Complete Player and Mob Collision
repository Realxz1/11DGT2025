-- This script ensures that the player wont collide with the mobs when playing. 
--It does this by checking if the player is in contact with mobs, 
--it would look under the Mobs folder (child) inside ServerStorage and the sprites(descendants), inside the mob folders
--and will make the player not collide with the mobs during gameplay.
-- Every Sprite in the game will contain as "BasePart" which is essentially the core of the sprite that can collide with players
