            <p><span>Rules</span><br>In a casino, there are nine positions around the table and a person will have a dealer button beside them (meaning they’ll shuffle and deal the cards out), and the two players to the dealer’s left side are forced to bet blindly. The person in the ‘Big Blind’ position posts the current minimum bet, while the person in the ‘Small Blind’ bets half the amount. The dealer would then hand out two cards (going clockwise, starting at the left side of the dealer’s button), and three cards known as ‘community cards’ (cards shared by all the players) in the middle. <strong>During the pre-flop round, the players have the choice to ‘call’, ‘raise’, or ‘fold’.</strong> The player in the 'Big Blind' doesn't need to bet again, but the player in the 'Small Blind' needs to bet another half of the current minimum bet in order to continue playing. <strong>After the three community cards are revealed, players have an extra option to say ‘check’, only doable after the pre-flop round. <em>The goal of poker is to have the best hand by the end of round to win the prize pool.</em></strong></p>

                    <p><span>Betting Rounds A.K.A Flops</span><br>There is a total of 4 rounds in a game of poker. The pre-flop round is the first round that introduces three community cards face-down. The second round flips the community cards face-up and allows the players around the table to make their choice. Then the third round introduces an extra community card to the table (face-up). The last round will then add one last community card making a total of 5 face-up community cards for the players to share. The dealer would then ask the  remaining players to reveal their hand, whoever has the best hand wins the prize pool (if playing in a casino).</p>

                        <li>Fold as early as you can if you know you can't win, never give your opponents an advantage</li>
                        <li>To bluff, you must act confident and keep a poker face, if you bluff too much, you become predictable</li>
                        <li>If you have been dealt a high pair (pocket aces) early on, don't get greedy </li>
                        <li><strong>PRO TIP:</strong> A game of poker will only end until one player wins all the chips, use this to your advanage to read the behaviours of your opponents. Reading your opponent's behaviour gives you the upper hand. You'll learn eventually. </li>
